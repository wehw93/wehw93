## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Egor  
Welcome to my digital Colosseum, where logic and code unite in harmony, like the mosaics of ancient Rome.  

### Who am I?  
A **Golang developer**, dedicated to the art of crafting robust and elegant solutions.  
Iâ€™m currently honing my skills at **School 21**, a place where challenges shape developers into masters of their craft.  
My tools are not swords or spears, but **Go**, **Docker**, and **databases**, forming the foundation of grand software structures.  

### What do I explore?  
- The art of **algorithms and data structures**, solving problems in the spirit of LeetCode.  
- Building **REST APIs**, as simple and reliable as aqueducts.  
- Mastering databases:  
  - **MongoDB**, **Postgres**, **MySQL**, **SQLite** â€” the pillars of my craft.  

### Tools of my trade:  
- **Golang** â€” my weapon to conquer any challenge.  
- **Docker & Docker Compose** â€” to construct projects as timeless as temples.  
- **Environment configuration** and secrets management â€” ensuring stability in every deployment.  

### My mission  
To create code that stands the test of time, like the bridges built by ancient engineers.
