## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Egor  
Welcome to my digital Colosseum, where logic and code unite in harmony, like the mosaics of ancient Rome.  

### Who am I?  
A **Golang developer**, dedicated to the art of crafting robust and elegant solutions.  
Iâ€™m currently honing my skills at **School 21**, a place where challenges shape developers into masters of their craft.  
My tools are not swords or spears, but **Go**, **Docker**, and **databases**, forming the foundation of grand software structures.  
In addition to **Golang**, I am well-versed in other programming languages like **C/C++**,**Java** which provide a broad perspective on solving complex problems.  

### My mission  
To create code that stands the test of time, like the bridges built by ancient engineers.
