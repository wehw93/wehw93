## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'am Egor
Welcome to my digital Colosseum, where logic and code unite in harmony, like the mosaics of ancient Rome.

Who am I?
A Golang developer, dedicated to the art of crafting robust and elegant solutions. My tools are not swords or spears, but Go, Docker, and databases, forming the foundation of grand software structures.

What do I explore?
The art of algorithms and data structures, solving problems in the spirit of LeetCode.
Building REST APIs, as simple and reliable as aqueducts.
Mastering databases:
MongoDB, Postgres, MySQL, SQLite â€” the pillars of my craft.
Tools of my trade:
Golang â€” my weapon to conquer any challenge.
Docker & Docker Compose â€” to construct projects as timeless as temples.
Environment configuration and secrets management â€” ensuring stability in every deployment.
My mission
To create code that stands the test of time, like the bridges built by ancient engineers.
